Primary Model vs Preliminary Model

The primary builds off the preliminary model and includes
the follwing additional features:
-profitability function (based on MA|data)
-predict buy function (based on MA|data)
-predict sell function (based on MA|data)

There have also been changes in the naming of some variables
and some functions from the originals in the preliminary
model.

The following will be added to the Primary Model:
-predict function (based on MA|MA)
-predict function (based on least squares)
-profitability function (based on MA|MA)
-profitability function (baseed on least squares)
